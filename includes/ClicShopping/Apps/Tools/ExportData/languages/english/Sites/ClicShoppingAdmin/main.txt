<li><p style="color:#FF0000;"> * </p> are our tips to follow for proper use of this tool. They apply to most configurations. </li> <li> We advise you save the file on the server and well remember his name if you have a large quantity of product.
<li> If you have a product range over 100 products, it will generate a file. Some options will be removed from this quota reached </li>
<blockquote>
- The creation of the file involves a mounted server load important. <br /> - The ideal practice is to have the same name as the export selected. <br /> (eg price comparison guide.com xml ===> filename: le_guidecom.xml or <br /> Kelkoo price comparison xml ===> filename: kelkoo.xml). <br /> The syntax will make it easy to generate a new file overwriting the old and update your data. <br />
- This procedure will be to achieve each time you change your data so that your file is always updated <br /> - Saving the file on the server is important because it will allow the server to retrieve information more easily without requiring resources to the server. <br />
- The options and fields are not taken into account now. <br />
